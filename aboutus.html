                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>The first tour operator went into business in England in 1758, and is still in business today. In
                    Europe, pleasure travel started in earnest during the 1840s, when Thomas Cook began conducting tours
                    to Paris and later around Europe. By the 1850s, railroad tours were already in operation. Modern
                    tour operators – companies that organize group tours and independent travel packages — date back to
                    the mid-nineteenth century, and most likely have their roots as ticket agents for steamship lines
                    and railroads. In addition to selling passage, the agents were eventually called upon to develop
                    itineraries and secure accommodations for their wealthy clients. Out of this grew the organized
                    business of selling planned tours to groups of travelers.</p>
                <p>Today there are over 600 tour operators in this country, plus hundreds in other countries. Most of
                    them wholesale their tours, that is, sell them through travel agents, or sell them directly over the
                    internet. Even in this day of the internet, where travelers can more readily create their own
                    itineraries, tour operators still have the advantage of bulk purchases that reduce costs, and of
                    inside knowledge of vendors and destinations.</p>
